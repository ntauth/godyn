Godyn is a Windows-only library that makes auditing, dissecting and changing Windows structures easier and quicker.

# Features
- Runtime dynamic link library symbol resolution (GetProcAddress).
- Tools for thread and process internal information (TEB and PEB) auditing.
- PE header parser.
- Hooking primitives (SetWindowsHookEx) and low-level IPC (WriteProcessMemory et al). This is still WIP.
